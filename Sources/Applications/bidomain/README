After compilation type one of the following commands to run an example:

./bidomain input/configOHaraRudy_MCs.lua input/variablesOHaraRudy.lua 0
./bidomain input/configOHaraRudy_Axion.lua input/variablesOHaraRudy.lua 1

For the first case, it will load the heretogeneity field 0 in "./hetero/".
For the second case, it will load the heretogeneity field 1 in "./hetero/".

In "./input/variablesOHaraRudy.lua", parameters of the OHara Rudy model are defined. The IKrActivation can be used to block the hERG channel and generate EADs.

Outputs will be in "Umes/" and "Vm/" of this directory.
